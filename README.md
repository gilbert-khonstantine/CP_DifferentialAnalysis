# Differential Analysis using Constraint Programming

This paper will discuss the differential attack on symmetric key Add- Rotate-XOR (ARX) Cipher and Substitution-Permutation Network (SPN) Cipher by using Constraint Programming (CP), Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) and Satisfiability (SAT). We will scrutinize their solving time as
 they calculate the minimum number of active S-box(es) for SPN cipher and the maximum differential probability for ARX cipher.
